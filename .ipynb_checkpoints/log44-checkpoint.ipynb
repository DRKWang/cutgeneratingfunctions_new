    "Comparing to 1-norm, $\\infty$-norm may be also a good candidate for this cones-seperating process, the big difference between them is the number of non-smooth corners, i.e. in a $n$-dimensional space, there are $2n$ corners for 1-norm, whereas there are $2^n$ corners for $\\infty$-norm. But, I did not come up with a good reason why 1-norm was chosen instead of $\\infty$-norm."

    "1. We will compute the compute the inclination first. We measure this inclination of fan with \"average point\" $q$. The average point is defined by $q = \\sum p_i$, $\\{p_i\\}$ are the points along with the generating rays of the fan and whose 1-norm are exactly 1.\n",

    "2. Then, choose a set of orthogonal basis $\\{v_j\\}$ coming from the complementary space of the space generated by $q$, i.e. $\\forall i$, $v_j  \\perp q$. Note that, since the average point $q$ could be zero vector, in that case, we will choose $N(1,0,...0)$, $N(0,1,..., 0)$,..., $N(0,0,...,1)$ as the basis. The chosen set of orthogonal basis  $\\{v_j\\}$ could be good candidates for seperating the cones of fan. One way of generating the orthogonal basis $\\{v_j\\}$ will be using [Gramâ€“Schmidt process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process).\n",
