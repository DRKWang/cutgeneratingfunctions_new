# So far

- I has gone through the contents from chapter 1 to chapter 4 in the "integer programming" book, the remaining chapter 5 and 6 is expected to be done in this week. I also plan to read dissertations of Jiawei Wang in this week after chapter 5 and 6.
- Also work on swig documentation, but not finished.
- Try to make a test file for cgal, which can be generated by abstracting [those offical testing examples](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal-swig-bindings/tree/main/examples/python). There are few points that may need to be clarified:
  1. What is the structure of it, a single py file or a bashscript file with many python files?
  2. Inside the cgal, there are many cgal libraries, such as libraries of Triangulations, Polygon Mesh Processing, should I test all of them or just the things that we may need?
  3. Is there any template or example for testing file in sagemath?
